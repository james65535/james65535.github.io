## Bio
{{< figure src="/jcanoli.png" title="Some weirdo..." >}}


I'm a computer super nerd üßê with a short memory and an insatiable desire to learn new things (these two elements are either the perfect combination or the absolute worst combination...).  I like to balance this intense interest with endeavors in Fine Art and Concept Art / Illustration.  When I lived in London, I had an art studio in New Cross and was fortunate to have my work on display at [The Mall Gallery](https://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/) in London, that's Mall as in [The Royal Mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mall,_London), not the one in the American sense üòÜ.

On the physical side I seem to oscillate over the years between Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Mountain Biking, Bouldering, and Muay Thai.  Thus completing the law that every computer nerd must participate in a martial art.

I'm originally from the UK but grew up dodging bullets in Detroit in the 80s (thanks mom and dad!). Over the years I've had a chance to travel quite a lot to live and work, maybe too much as once during a four year period I had lived on four different continents!  Probably my most favourite and intense experience was living in Hong Kong and working in Beijing, Shanghai, and Macau on a regular basis.

I now reside in Australia with my son and our [Ackie Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny-tailed_monitor).  His name is Admiral "It's a Trap Mother Fu.....!" Ackbar, or AA for short.
